# IoT_based_smart_energy_meter_monitoring_with_theft_detection_system
The development and implementation of the Smart Energy Metre Monitoring and Theft 
Detection System was accomplished with success. The system successfully monitored the 
energy consumption of the consumer and identified instances of theft or tampering with the 
energy metre. The system offered instantaneous monitoring of energy consumption, enabling 
the user to monitor their usage and make informed decisions regarding energy consumption.

The hardware implementation of the project is depicted in Figure, wherein all the 
components are interconnected and the limit switch is positioned within the energy metre to 
detect instances of theft.

Figure illustrates the operational state of the system, specifically when the Arduino is 
supplied with 5V power and the GSM Module is supplied with 12V power. During this state, 
the system is activated, causing the bulb to emit light. This state is referred to as the Normal
Condition, wherein the bulb emits light and the pulses are counted correspondingly. 
Here, we have considered:
1 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡 = 2 𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑠𝑒𝑠
The specific pulses may exhibit variability contingent upon the electricity department and are 
subject to modification within the Arduino code.
